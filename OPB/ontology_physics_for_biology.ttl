    :OPB_01768 """Rate properties represent the FORCE DIFFERENTIAL or the RATE OF FLOW of material, charge, energy, or information across a boundary separating one physical entity from another via some pathway. Examples:

1) fluid flow rate through a tube or vessel (dimensions of volume/time) 
2) charge flow rate of an electrical current through an ion channel or wire (dimensions of charge/time or current) 
3) chemical flux through a reaction kinetic pathway (dimensions of amount/time typially moles/sec or concentration/time)
4) the force in a spring as applied by entities at either end and as transmitted through the length of the spring. 

Rate properties can be properly attributed to entities in two mathematically equivalent, but logically different, ways.

1) Representing the source/sink of a process where the rate properties are attributed to participants in a process. For example, a fluid flow process has a fluid-source entity and a fluid-sink entity so that the fluid rate is expressed as flow from source-to-sink. Similarly, mechanical process is due to forces exerted by \"entity A\" upon \"entity B\" . This kind of formulation asserts that the flow/force properties are so-called \"cross properties\" because they describe how energy is transmitted across a process in which entities participate.

2) Representong rates as \"through\" properties  as attributes of a \"mediator\" that is an entity through which the process occurs. For a fluid flow process, the fluid flow rate is thus attributed to the flow conduit (or more properly, the lumen of the conduit) that mediates the source-to-sink flow. Or, in the case of the transmission of mechanical force, across the interface or boundary between two mechanical solid entities.

These different approaches yield mathematically equivalent results yet their semantic-logical representations differ ways that is a burden for the reasoning required to detect and resolve their equivalence. In the \"cross\" representation, source/sink enities are represented as source/sink participants in a process. In the \"through\" representation, source/sink entities are represented as parts of an entity that \"mediates\" the process.



The distinction between \"through\" and \"cross\" properties (variables in math models) is commonly used in engineerng analyses such the PhysSys ontology; see:

By rights, a conductance (or its inverse, resistance) is a constitutive property of an electrochemical flow process (see: OPB:Electrical conductance). However, we classify ionic conductances as dynamical amounts because they are, ultimately, determined by the aggregates of the molecular conformational states of the ionic channels mediating the electropotential ion transport. Thus, these classes are suitable for representing the conductance ion channels at a moment in time, as well as the conductance of ion channel as characterized for standard conditions and by which the channel is named (e.g., \"250 pS Ca-dependent K-channel\")""", """Constitutive proportionalities apply only to those constitutive dependencies that can be expressed by which the dependent property is proportional to the independent property. Any other algebraic form of the dependency may have specifially-defined parameters (e.g., offsets, rate parameters). Given the creativity and license of modelers for creating the best fit to constitutive dependencies, the parameters of such non-proportional dependencies must be annotated by some local mechanism that does not depend on OPB classifications.

Constitutive proportionalities are approximations to dependencies for which a first-order, linear approximation is sufficient for the purposes of analysis. Piecewise linear approximations may apply over a limited range of dynamical property values. In general, various algebraic functions may be required using one or more parameters to fit observed dependency relationships. Given the range of possible constitutive dependencies, OPB defers representing such possibilities on a case-by-case basis for specific use-cases.

Non-proportionality constants include coefficients and parameters required to characterize linear and nonlinear dependencies that are not simple proportionalities. Some may constitutive dependencies may include dynamic modeling schemes with internal dynamic states (e.g., the \"gating variable\" of Hodgkin-Huxley ion gating equations). We will treat such properties as \"internal\" to the constitutive dependency, shielded from other entities in the system and known solely as hypothetical constructs derived as constitutively observed dynamic phenomena. Thus, HH gating variables will be classified as properties of constitutive dependencies which are also subclasses of Dynamical property without, however, declaring a Dynamical entity of which it is a property.

Important to realize that MM params, HH params, etc. are all derived and asserted by virtue of curve-fits to the directly observed attributes of a system; number of gating particles and their respective states is entirely inferential by best fits and, so, are no more physically real than any other coefficient or parameter.""" ;

_______________________________________

OPB:Physical dimension subclasses are a set of base dimensions as identified by either:

IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) in their \"Green Book\" [1] as summarized in: \"Concise Summary of  Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry\" [2]. IUPAC \"base quantities\" are: 

length, time, mass, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, luminosity, amount of substance.

UCUM (Unified Code for Units of Measure [3]) defines an alternative (but ultimately, equivalent) set of base \"quantity kinds\" [4] as:

length, time, mass, charge, temperature, luminous intensity, angle.

In either system, a coherent set of \"working\" property dimensions can be derived for for other physical properties as products of base dimensions raised to integer (both positive and negative) powers (e.g., velocity = length•time-1, pressure = force•length-2, volume = length+3).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature

Because temperature is an intensive property that properly only applies to a single point in an entity, assigning a \"temperature\" as a property of a discretized physical entity that extends is space presents problems. If temperature is constant over the spatial extent of an entity (i.e., it is \"isothermic\") then it is fair to say that the entity has a single value of temperature. Such an assumption is quite often made for homeothermic biological organisms and their parts. However, it is not meaningful to calculate a spatial integral of temperature derive an \"average” temperature because such integrals have meaning only for extensive properties like mass density or current density.  However, some analyses do aim to account explicitly for temperature gradients that drive heat transfers between entities or parts of entities. In such cases it is useful to define, for continuum modeling, a spatial distribution for temperature and heat fluxes. 

However, for discrete modeling, the temperature of an entity can be assigned a value while its parts are assigned different temperatures — the discrete analogue of a continuum temperature distribution. For example, the temperature of mitochondria is likely to be higher than the surrounding portion of cytosol. That being said, there is utility in expressing that a discrete, dynamical entity can have a discrete temperature property with one value while allowing one or more of its parts to have separate temperature properties with different values. For computational purposes one can make the assumption that all parts of an entity share the same temperature property instance as the (whole) entity while parts that have a different temperature will have their own temperature property with a value that may difffer from the temperature value of the whole entity (and the other parts).""" ;

———

OPB has been formulated to support the development, annotation, description and sharing of analytical models. Although developed in the domain of biology, biophysics and physiology, its underlying assumptions, form and content is applicable for the analysis of non-biological engineering systems.

OPB aims to facilitate and expedite the annotation and cross-referencing of physics-based analytical models in the broad realm of biomedicine. In curating the OPB, we have strived to represent biophysical knowledge of applicable to biological physical entities, processes, and functions using the formal tools and concepts of computational ontology as expressed in description logic (DL),and  web ontology language (OWL).  

OPB has classes that represent abstractions of key classes in BFO such as BFO:Continuant (OPB:Physics continuant). BFO:Processural entity  (OPB:Processural entity), and BFO:Attribute (OPB:Physics attribute). A key differentiator is that OPB represents physical entities not represented in BFO such thermodynamic energy, potential energy fields, information. In particular, OPB:Physical process ia defined as the flow of energy and/or information amongst process participants. These are essential concepts for explaining, understanding and testing of biophysical hypotheses.

To emphasize intent of the OPB as an ontology of analytical concepts, we have purposely named its top class and its subclasses using the term \"Physics\" to reference the science of physics rather than the term \"physical\" which could imply that OPB intends to represent the \"real\" physical world.

The OPB does not extend to include quantum or relativistic physics, nor is it intended to recapitulate the axiomatic basis of physics as a theoretical framework. Rather, OPB is focuses on foundational theory of classical physics particularly as applied in system dynamics. For example, it encompasses discrete systems analysis (using ordinary differential equations; ODEs), continuum systems analysis (using partial differential equations; PDEs), discrete \"agent-based\" modeling, and causal propagation models.

 the first version of the OPB is targeted solely to discrete systems analysis."""^^xsd:string ;

–––––––––

Our current representation of geometrical forms is based implicitly on engineering intuitions and, thus, may be changed to reflect the rigor of available spatial ontologies

––––––––

Shape models provide a set of geometrical abstractions commonly used by physiologists to represent anatomical participants in biological processes.

IMPORTANT: An OPB:Shape model is NOT an OPB:Spatial region. Rather, a shape model is a geometrical abstraction that simply defines a set of mathematical dependencies between Spatial shape amount properties. For example, the surface area a rectangular plate is the product of its major and minor spans. The extent to which such geometrical dependencies are to be represented as OPB:Dependency classes is yet to be determined.

Some Shape models  have more than one topological part (e.g., a wall part and a lumenal part). Each part can be \"filled\" by a portion of material (e.g., cardiac muscle, blood, air) whose Dynamical properties may be equated with Shape model properties; for example the Lumenal volume of shape lumen could be equated with the Fluid volume of the portion of fluid occupying the shape lumen.

The set of Shape model classes is quite sparse and are not intended to be exhaustive. For example where a cardiac ventricle and its contained blood have a very complex geometry which has been modeled as a thick-walled sphere of cardiac muscle enclosing a portion of blood. To pursue more complex geometries (e.g., thick-walled ellipsoid, thick-walled hemiellipsoid) exposes a representative slippery slope that is, rightfully, the  domain of spatial and geometrical ontologies devoted to such tasks. Our current goal is to represent commonly used, simple geometrical abstractions -- the 80% solution for available modeling use-cases.

(1) the \"Nernst potenial\" for a single ionic species whether or not it permeates the membrane as calculated by the Nernst equation that has terms the ratio of inner-to-outer ion concentrations (e.g., [Nai] / [Nao]) but no term of ionic permebility. That is, Nernst potentials are function only of the ion gradient (as a ratio) and not of ion permeability according to the Nernst equation. Thus, a Nernst reversal potential (for a single ion) can only be measured empirically under strict equilibrium conditions where membranes are permeable only to ions and there are no transmembrane ion currents, as from electrogenicl pumps.

(2) the \"GHK potential\"  (Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz potential) applies multiple ionic species and depends on their relative permeabilities as can be calculated using the GHK equation if all ion gradient ratios and relative permeabilities are known. The GHK reversal potential can be determined experimentally for a membrane as its resting membrane potential for which there is no net ion flux.

For example, mass density depends on both the spatial distribution of atoms and the atomic weight of each. Resistance of a conductor depends on the resistivity of the material in the wire which is only defined and determinable empirically.

There are two conflicting views of constitutive properties as properties of processes or of continuant entities:

1.  The definition of constitutive property as a \"ratio or partial derivative\" of physical property values necessarily implicates a measurement process whereby values of two or more physical properties are varying and are measured and computed. However...

2.  Constitutive properties are conventionally viewed as inherent attributes of a continuant or a process: 

    .  mass density is the ratio of a material amount to the extent of the spatial region that it occupies.
    . resistivity is the ratio of a potential difference to current flow rate for a an electrical flow process
    .

3) what is common to each case is that \"constitutive properties\" are defined in the context of a specific entity or process in a manner that depends on the material and structural composition of the entities participating in the measurement process.

Any other algebraic form of the dependency may have specifially-defined parameters (e.g., offsets, rate parameters). Given the creativity and license of modelers for creating the best fit to constitutive dependencies, the parameters of such non-proportional dependencies must be annotated by some local mechanism that does not depend on OPB classifications.

Constitutive proportionalities are approximations to dependencies for which a first-order, linear approximation is sufficient for the purposes of analysis. Piecewise linear approximations may apply over a limited range of dynamical property values. In general, various algebraic functions may be required using one or more parameters to fit observed dependency relationships. Given the range of possible constitutive dependencies, OPB defers representing such possibilities on a case-by-case basis for specific use-cases.

Non-proportionality constants include coefficients and parameters required to characterize linear and nonlinear dependencies that are not simple proportionalities. Some may constitutive dependencies may include dynamic modeling schemes with internal dynamic states (e.g., the \"gating variable\" of Hodgkin-Huxley ion gating equations). We will treat such properties as \"internal\" to the constitutive dependency, shielded from other entities in the system and known solely as hypothetical constructs derived as constitutively observed dynamic phenomena. Thus, HH gating variables will be classified as properties of constitutive dependencies which are also subclasses of Dynamical property without, however, declaring a Dynamical entity of which it is a property.

Important to realize that MM params, HH params, etc. are all derived and asserted by virtue of curve-fits to the directly observed attributes of a system; number of gating particles and their respective states is entirely inferential by best fits and, so, are no more physically real than any other coefficient or parameter.""" ;

   reversal potential = K ln( amount of ion outside / amount of ion inside ) 

see: Wikpedia (Nernst potential):

The Nernst equation relates the chemical concentration gradient to the electric gradient at which there is no net electrodiffusional driving force between two portion of charged particles.

The Nernst equation has a physiological application when used to calculate the potential of an ion of charge z across a membrane. This potential is determined using the concentration of the ion both inside and outside the cell.

see: Wikpedia (reversal potential):

In a biological membrane, the reversal potential (also known as the Nernst potential) of an ion is the membrane potential at which there is no net (overall) flow of that particular ion from one side of the membrane to the other. In the case of post-synaptic neurons, the reversal potential is the membrane potential at which a given neurotransmitter causes no net current flow of ions through that neurotransmitter receptor's ion channel.
