bqbiol:hasMediator rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
             rdfs:comment "The biological process (e.g., a reaction) has mediators (e.g., enzymes) as listed by the reference resource. Mediators can inhibit as well as enable or enhance a reaction. " .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/hasPart
bqbiol:hasPart rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
         rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element includes the subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B), either physically or logically. This relation might be used to link a complex to the description of its components." .

bqbiol:hasPhysicalEntity rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
                   rdfs:comment "An attribute of the link between an entity and a process. 'hasPhysicalEntity' connects this participation link to the physical entity description of the participant. To use this qualifier, one must have a reified link." .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/hasProperty
bqbiol:hasProperty rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
             rdfs:comment "The subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B) is a property of the biological entity represented by the model element. This relation might be used when a biological entity exhibits a certain enzymatic activity or exerts a specific function." .

bqbiol:hasSink rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
         rdfs:comment "The biological process (e.g., a reaction) has outputs (sinks) as listed by the referenced resource. For reactions, these are the products." .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/hasSource
bqbiol:hasSource rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
           rdfs:comment "The biological process (e.g., a reaction) has inputs (sources) as listed by the referenced resource. For reactions, these are the reactants. " .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/hasTaxon
bqbiol:hasTaxon rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
          rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element is taxonomically restricted, where the restriction is the subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B). This relation may be used to ascribe a species restriction to a biochemical reaction." .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/hasVersion
bqbiol:hasVersion rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
            rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element is a more general version of the subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B). For example, this relation may be used to connect a generic form of a protein in a model to a species-specific version in Uniprot." .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/is
bqbiol:is rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element has identity with the subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B). This relation might be used to link a reaction to its exact counterpart in a database, for instance." .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/isDescribedBy
bqbiol:isDescribedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
               rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element is described by the subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B). This relation should be used, for instance, to link a species or a parameter to the literature that describes the concentration of that species or the value of that parameter." .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/isEncodedBy
bqbiol:isEncodedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
             rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element is encoded, directly or transitively, by the subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B). This relation may be used to express, for example, that a protein is encoded by a specific DNA sequence." .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/isHomologTo
bqbiol:isHomologTo rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
             rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element is homologous to the subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B). This relation can be used to represent biological entities that share a common ancestor." .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/isPartOf
bqbiol:isPartOf rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
          rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element is a physical or logical part of the subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B). This relation may be used to link a model component to a description of the complex in which it is a part." .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/isPropertyOf
bqbiol:isPropertyOf rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
              rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element is a property of the referenced resource (biological entity B)." .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/isRelatedTo
bqbiol:isRelatedTo rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
             rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element is somehow associated, directly or transitively, with the subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B). This qualifier may be used as a generic way to express any biological relationship." ;
             owl:deprecated "Deprecated" .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/isVersionOf
bqbiol:isVersionOf rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
             rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element is a more specific version or an instance of the subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B). This relation may be used to connect, for example, a specific process in the model to a generic process name in the Gene Ontology." .


###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/occursIn
bqbiol:occursIn rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
          rdfs:comment "The biological entity represented by the model element is physically limited to a location, which is the subject of the referenced resource (biological entity B). This relation may be used to ascribe a compartmental location, within which a reaction takes place." .

###  http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/hasMultiplier
bqbiol:hasMultiplier rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty ;
               rdfs:range xsd:integer ;
               rdfs:comment "An attribute of the link between an entity and a process, that indicates the stoichiometry of that relationship. For example, a 'source' of a reaction may need three copies of some participant; thus, hasMultiplier would be three. To use this qualifier, one must reify (make a separate object) the 'hasSource' or 'hasSink' link." .
